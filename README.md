# Progress
Progress HR solution. Built in PHP for maximum flexibility, let Progress manage all of your HR needs. We use
Progress at Teenage Helpline to manage our full-time staff, volunteers and job positions.

Progress makes all data available via an API, to allow you to easily integrate it into your existing and
future systems.

## Development & Contributing
You are welcome to develop and contribute to Progress. Please clone the repository, make any changes you wish to
recommend and then submit a pull request with your changes. If they are accepted, they will be merged into the
master branch as soon as possible.

### Developing with Vagrant and Puppet
We have included a Vagrantfile and Puppet manifest within the repository to aid development and testing. If you
have chosen to contribute to the project, we suggest that you use the Vagrantfile provided complete with its Puppet
configuration. You may also use this solution to easily test Progress before deciding to deploy it.

Please ensure that Vagrant and Puppet are both installed on your system.

After Vagrant and Puppet are installed, simply type "vagrant up" or use your IDE tools to launch the Vagrant
instance and begin testing.
